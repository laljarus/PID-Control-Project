# PID Control Project

The aim of this project is to implement a PID ( Propotional Integral and Derivative Controller) to keep a vehicle in the center of the road.This writeup discusses how each point in the project requirements are considered in the project implementation and also how the parameters of the controller is tuned.

### The follwoing steps are involved in designing the PID controller.
1. Identification of System Model
2. Controller Design

## System Identification
In order to design a controller it is important to understand the behaviour of the system. The following picture shows the overview of the control loop for controlling the steering of the vehicle.
